                                            XEmerald.com - Tokenized Real Estate Investment Platform
                                                          Complete Project Plan
XEmerald.com will be a web application that simulates tokenized real estate investment, focusing on the Falkor Fund’s Emerald Island and GREENPORT projects. The platform aims to illustrate how blockchain technology enables fractional ownership of large-scale real estate developments, offering an intuitive, visually appealing experience for potential investors.

Core MVP Components
1. Technology Stack
Frontend
React: For a component-based UI architecture, enabling modular and reusable code.
Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI: For modern, responsive design with pre-built, customizable components.
Chart.js: For financial visualizations and investment projections, such as growth charts.
Web3.js: For blockchain interaction, simulating token transactions.
React Testing Library: For testing frontend components and ensuring UI reliability.
Backend
Node.js with Express: For API endpoints and server-side logic to handle requests and responses.
Server-side In-memory Storage: For temporary user data persistence during simulation (e.g., token balances).
Simple ERC-20 Token Contract Simulation: To mimic blockchain functionality without requiring a live network.
Jest: For API and integration testing to validate backend functionality.
JSDoc: For thorough code documentation, ensuring maintainability.
